My name is Marek Mierzwa. I'm a husband, father, spiritual journeyman, and in meantime a software developer. Speaking of the last one I spent most of the time coding in back-ends,
working with enterprise search systems and in general - designing and implementing distributed architectures. 

I'm a typical lazy programmer and [don't like to repeat my self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) so if you want to read more about my professional life take a look at [my LinkedIn profile]({{site.social.linkedin}}) or (the better way) just read this blog. Have a nice reading.
