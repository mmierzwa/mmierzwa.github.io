Those of you who enter this blog from time to time probably noticed that there was not update since 4 months. I hope this will change due to my intensive learning in mobile development area. 

There will be new posts about my little wins and fails related with Xamarin, iOS and Android platforms - some of them published here and some cross-blogged from [Solidbrain blog](https://solidbrain.com/blog/). Of corse I still want to continue the enterprise search topic I started some time ago. I hope you'll enjoy the reading.

Cheers!
