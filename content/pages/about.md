Hi! My name is Marek Mierzwa. Who I am?

* First and foremost - a human being üòä A humanist, I guess ü§î
* A proud husband and father of two wonderful children. And a dog caretaker üêæ

Beside of that, I love good food, enjoy the world and people ü•∞ I like traveling and exploring (physically, mentally, spiritually), learning and trying new stuff.

My hobbies? DIY projects (various types), HAM radio (my callsign is [SP9GO](https://www.qrz.com/db/sp9go)) electronics, astronomy/astronautics, coding (not only for living), tabletop RPGs, retro computing, puzzles, psychology, Lego and much more than I can think of right now.
